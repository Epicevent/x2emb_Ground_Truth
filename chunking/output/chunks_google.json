In consideration of the characteristics and development environment of the weapon system and R & D project, if it is necessary to change the basic business management procedure or adjust the main disruption, it will be reflected in the basic strategy of the project promotion.  The main performance details in the search development stage are as follows. In accordance with the core technology acquisition plan for the weapon system for R & D, the technology developed through simulation or model production and test is proved through the production and test of prototypes. Foot or development may be undertaken for long -term order items or core technology development items that must be preceded for the timely performance of system development.In this case, it is necessary to clearly distinguish between the scope of search development work and the required matters. System requirements will be reviewed, technical maturity evaluation, operation of operation, operation performance performance, evolutionary R & D strategy, system development schedule and cost calculation, and preliminary test evaluation basic plan will be carried out.In this case, professional manpower such as the requirements (including operations, maintenance, management personnel), national sources, preliminary sources, and private research institutes should be reviewed.And the quality assurance opinion of the Yangsan Hall should be presented. Technology maturity evaluation is performed and the results are reflected in the decision to enter the system development stage. The main performance of the system development stage is as follows.

Prior Research Stage: The Defense Business Policy Bureau of Defense Business Policy applies the procedures of Article 35 to 37, taking into account the progressive research in consideration of the concept design of the trap weapon system determined by long -term electricity or mid -term power.In order to be used for the previous research and analysis, the concept design results are notified to the Kook -Ki.3. Basic design stage: The head of the integrated business management team embodies the required requirements based on the operational operation performance and requirements, and confirms the definition specifications and performance, the deployment of the mounting system/equipment, and the interworking system, and the system.Basic design reviews, including requirements and system function reviews, are performed, and the outputs such as system/depth design technology, drying salary, and material list are prepared.In this case, the basic design is divided into preliminary design and contract design.Perform a test evaluation.4. Detailed design and leading drying stage: If a provisional combination decision is made through the basic design test evaluation, the head of the Integrated Business Management Team is based on the basic design results, detailed technical reports and work drawings for drying and operationAnd the construction of technical materials required for operation, operation/maintenance training, guidelines for management and the development of comprehensive munitions, etc. are built.During the detailed design period, the detailed design review is performed and the design decision review (DDR) is performed to determine whether to start the construction and the subsequent construction.The decision is made through the specifications.The Soyo Army cooperates in the field management in the process of drying the lead, and conducts a test test evaluation to determine the combat for combat for the results of the leading drying.5. Subsequent Drying Stage: Basic Design Test Evaluation results are determined by provisional combat suitable for provisional combat, and the subsequent drying procedure is dried by applying the follow -up.Can."
