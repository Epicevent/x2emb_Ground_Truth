            "content": " Under Title III of the Enactment of the Law on Innovation, weapons systems research and development is undertaken on the principle that it's separated into exploration and development stages, systems development stages and generation stages, and in this case, according to the business model strategy, you can either skip exploration and development stages, or you can select the manufacturer before the end of the system development stage, and you can start manufacturing first, and you can integrate system development and manufacturing to select the manufacturer.  If there's a need to modify or adjust key decision-making processes in order to take into account the characteristics of the weapons system and R&amp;D business, and the development environment, then we can apply them to the business base strategy.  The major areas of exploration and development are: In accordance with the core technology acquisition plan for the research and development target weapons system, we perform the technology development work, and we certify the technology developed through simulation or modeling and testing, and we certify the technology through prototyping and testing. You can start a long-term project or a subsystem core technology project, and you have to clearly define the scope of your exploration and development work and whether it's necessary or not, and then you have to minimize the cost. It performs system checks, technical proficiency assessments, operational validation, operational utility decisions, development strategies for evolutionary research and development, system development schedules and cost estimates, preparation of preliminary test pilots, and so on. In this case, it involves the expertise of the troops, including customs, maintenance and management, the government, the suppliers, the rapid response teams, and private laboratories, and the suppliers, in particular, have to collect the RAM data, the outputs and the quality data, and provide a quality assurance viewpoint for the production. We perform a skill assessment, and we reflect the results of that assessment when we decide to enter the system development phase. Here are some of the key deliverables of the system development phase. It's a step in designing a weapons system that satisfies the operational capability of a weapons system that has been determined in the mid-term by means of a small-scale decision-making process, and then it's a step in developing a weapons system that can be generated through a prototyping process, through a test-evaluation process, through a design process to verify the integrity of the system, and then it's a step in manufacturing a prototype that goes from part to system, and then it's a step in testing it through a test-evaluation process, and the details of that are set out in Chapter 78. The completion date of the system development phase is the completion date of the national defence regulation. We do a manufacturing mastery review, and the results are reflected in a decision about whether or not to enter the generative phase. In this case, it's only done in cases where exploration and development is denied, and in this case, you can selectively apply a set of small business control measures, depending on the nature of the business. When you do a basic design review, a detailed design review, and so on, you have to have a team of specialists, including customs, maintenance, management, state, spare parts, rapid response, and private labs, and in this case, the spare parts team has to collect the RAM data analysis results and the quality data, and have an opinion on the quality assurance of the product. The main function of the generation stage is to generate a fully developed weapons system, which can then be differentiated into first generation and second generation for efficient business management.  The head of the integrated business management team, if he or she wants to pursue the next stage of R&amp;amp;amp;amp;D, whether it's a research development plan or a system development plan, or if he or she is selected for the next phase of R&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;  The head of the integrated business management team should reflect on the policy and economic considerations of the city's radiation improvement business in the next phase of the business development plan, the technical proficiency and manufacturing proficiency assessment results at that stage, and in this case, the technical proficiency assessment follows the \"TRA\" guidelines, and the manufacturing proficiency assessment follows the \"MRA\" guidelines.  The head of the Integrated Business Administration can close the business if he fails to meet the manufacturing fitness target three or more times in the process of developing the system and entering the generation phase.  The head of the integrated business management team must conduct a business review of the development company during the business cycle of the weapons system research and development (exploration and system development), and the results of the business review can be used as a mid-term review of the research and development company and the agreement, and in this case, the details of the business review are in accordance with the \"Contract Conclusion Standards by the Open Skies Business Negotiation.\"  Software development undertaken in the framework of weapons research and development must be conducted in accordance with the \"Guidelines for the Development and Management of Software for the Armed Forces.\"  The head of the integrated business management team, in the process of starting a business, if you need technical personnel, equipment and supplies, you can use national experts, suppliers, rapid dispatchers, etc., outside of the country.  The head of the integrated business management team is required by the R&amp;D regulatory authority to perform the necessary backstopping to prevent and minimize accidents and injuries during test-driving. In this case, backstopping can include guarantees against the occurrence of human or physical damage, and in the case of guarantees, the regulatory authority has to take into account business risks, testing environments and contingency planning, and apply the provisions of the Emergency Industrial Protection Ordinance.  The head of the integrated business management team, in accordance with section 7 of the R&amp;amp;amp;D report, if some of the R&amp;amp;amp;D results included in the R&amp;amp;D report are not satisfactory, then the R&amp;amp;D team's recommendations on the underdeveloped technologies and the R&amp;amp;D plan proposed by the development agency (development plan, pre-technology, collaborative research, etc.) can review them, and then decide whether to change the business schedule, decide whether to move the business forward, and so on.  In the case of weapons systems R&amp;amp;D projects that are powered and operated on platforms, such as ships and aircraft, the head of the integrated business management team will form a system coordination committee to coordinate the effective system integration with the platforms, including troops, development agencies (nuclear core technology and weapons systems R&amp;amp;amp;D and management agencies) that are operating on the platforms, and equipment business teams, suppliers of supplies and equipment, and so on, and to coordinate the timing and methodology, operating costs, ICDs, and so on for the effective system integration during the course of the business.  In the case of R&amp;D on weapons systems where A.I. is applied, you have to prepare a plan for the collection and management of the necessary data. In the case of R&amp;D on recycling equipment in each unit, you have to submit a plan for technical assistance for recycling equipment from each unit. "

Exploration and development. R&amp;amp;D works to complete electricity generation through system development. It's a business where government investment is considered beneficial, taking into account the characteristics of other businesses, the timing of electrification, the cost, etc. If there is a need for technical cooperation with a foreign country in pursuing domestic R&amp;D, due to the lack of domestic technological standards or the demands of the buyer country in terms of exports, then, at the initial stage of the research, the analysis of the domestic technological standards, the situation of foreign technology reserves and the method of ensuring technological cooperation, etc., are included in the business baseline strategy, and if necessary, the committee will consider whether or not to cooperate.  National R&amp;D projects are generally managed by the Integrated Business Management Team, which is the company that manages the system design and prototype manufacturing, and in this case, the head of the Integrated Business Management Team can, if necessary, conduct the core process and quality management and so on in an efficient manner. In order to do this, the head of the Integrated Business Management Team can appoint his or her employees to the development department in accordance with the \"Rules on Sub-Organization Biases of Organizations owned by the Agency owned by the Ministry of Defense.\" However, national R&amp;D projects, which are managed by the National Institutes of Technology, are managed by the Integrated Business Management Team, which manages the business, and the National Institutes of Technology prepare development plans, regulations and technical documents, and conducts testing, quality assurance, troop support, and so on, and manufactures prototypes.  The head of the Integrated Business Administration can enforce the agreement if it's a corporate investment or a joint venture under Section 4(1) of the \"Implementation of the Law on Innovation.\"  The head of the integrated business management team must review whether the terms of the contract have been fulfilled after the company's investment or co-investment, and in the case of a quality management system certification company, as determined by the head of the business headquarters, the proportion of co-investment among the co-participants and so on. If you're a co-investor, you've got the investment cost allocation according to Star 5, year-by-year. Dismantling contracts for government or corporate liability -- how to deal with companies' R&amp;D funds in the event of termination R&D, prototyping, etc. In the case of corporate investment, it's government ownership or enforcement of corporate ownership of knowledge assets. And then there's the need for business. In the case of companies investing in weapons systems, where they haven't achieved their targets through step-by-step assessments and so on, they can continue to do so if they can extend the time frame of the agreement so that the weapons system's development is more feasible.  The head of the integrated business management team is required to issue a weapons system R&amp;amp;amp;D certificate, indicating that the manufacturer of the weapons system is a military licensee, after the weapons system has been standardized for the company's investment or co-investment, and to report it to the defense industry development government, the contracting authority, the military, the suppliers, the Korea Defense Industry Development Committee, etc., but if a contract is possible without the weapons system R&amp;amp;D certificate and without any regulation, you can't issue a R&amp;amp;D certificate.  The head of the Integrated Business Administration can, if it is necessary to conduct a company's R&amp;amp;D business efficiently, request technical assistance from the state and suppliers in accordance with Article 11 of the R&amp;amp;D Implementation Rules, and in advance consult with the technical assistance organization, and the cost of the technical assistance can be reflected in the R&amp;amp;D contribution budget in advance.

The head of the integrated business management team has to develop a business strategy that reflects the fact that it has been reviewed that it is feasible to conduct a return R&amp;amp;D in a given business at the advance research stage, but it can also review whether it is feasible to conduct a return R&amp;amp;D in addition to the advance research if necessary.  The head of the integrated business management selects two R&amp;D institutions or a pilot company through proposal evaluation and negotiation.  The R&amp;amp;D business in return is based on integrating R&amp;amp;D with system development, and where necessary, R&amp;amp;D is viable.  In the case of R&amp;amp;D in return, the R&amp;amp;D department writes the R&amp;amp;D implementation plan, and in the case of R&amp;amp;D in the State Department, the R&amp;amp;D department writes the R&amp;amp;D implementation plan, and the head of the integrated business management department has to submit the R&amp;amp;D implementation plan to the contractor of the R&amp;amp;D in the State Department.  The head of the Integrated Business Administration manages the selection process, including the target management plan, the maximum number of generating units proposed by the R&amp;D companies, the system development plan, and so on.  The final weapons systems, equipment or components for a return R&amp;D project are decided upon by the committee or the peer review board, and the principle is to apply the minimum cost methodology when the requirements are met, and then the combined assessment methodology when necessary. In this case, the decision on the final weapons systems, equipment or components for a return R&amp;D project can be pursued simultaneously with the deliberations of the committee or the peer review board on the generation plan under Article 84.  In the case of systems development undertaken by a repurchase R&amp;D business, we look at the end of the R&amp;D period when the targeted weapons system is determined, and the regulatory process is completed for the targeted weapons system, but in the case of non-targeted weapons systems, the R&amp;D period is the end of the R&amp;D period when the targeted weapons system is eliminated.  The integrated business management team and the R&amp;amp;D regulatory body must take action on the results of the system development, regardless of the outcome of the after-sales R&amp;amp;D operation, after the outcome of the after-sales testing and evaluation.

The research and development should be carried out in order to maximize the integrated combat capability by integrating and optimizing the systems related to the integrated combat functions, navigational functions, navigational functions, communication functions, organ functions, injury control functions, etc.  If you need to develop the key technologies that you need for the R&amp;amp;D of an inertial weapons system, you can do the R&amp;amp;D of the core technologies under Title 2, Title 5, of the Innovation Act or under Title V.  When you're trying to load onto a function that's being developed for domestic R&amp;amp;D, the principle is that you have to perform a real-time test of the performance of the main characteristics, and then you load it onto the function, but if the R&amp;amp;D equipment and the target characteristics are being developed at the same time, you can perform a test of the first use, a test of the first use, a test of the first use, and then you can load it onto the function and perform a test of the first use.  The head of the integrated business management team, in consultation with the small group and the supplier, will include the items that require certification from a public professional body to ensure the survival and safety of the function, and the supplier will then have to agree with the head of the integrated business management team to establish and implement a quality assurance action plan.  The principle here is that new inputs, including R&amp;D equipment, that are required to be integrated with the shipyard, are installed in the shipyard, and the time when the performance check is completed -- the time when the supplier passes the inspection -- is called the \"shipment day,\" except that if the shipyard inspection of the equipment is required before the shipyard inspection is scheduled for the shipyard inspection day, the shipyard inspection day can be specified in the specific terms of the contract, or in the agreements, through negotiations, and in this case, it has to be reflected in the proposals, in the consultations, and so on.  The Integrated Operations Management Team of the Functional Platform complies with Article 56(14) of the Civil Aviation Safety and Security Regulation to ensure that all weapons systems, equipment, facilities, components, software and so on are integrated into the Functional Platform.  The head of the integrated business management team, if it's determined that there's a need for a research on functional specialization, after consulting with the state or the supplier, can conduct the research on the specialization with the state or the supplier, but it's necessary to integrate the management by considering the interconnection with the functional business, and the maintenance and development of functional specialization technology is done by the state or the supplier.  In the case of submersibles, we have to do systematic resistance management at every level of the business, and we have to ultimately verify that resistance through a resistance management board.  The inventor undertakes the quality assurance work for the R&amp;D of an inertial weapons system in accordance with Article 2, paragraph 3, of T.G.71, and the detailed procedures are governed by the \"Quality Management Regulations for the Civil Aviation.\"  The other thing that I don't say in this paragraph is that we're ignoring the R&amp;D gap for conventional weapons systems.

Research institutions that have transferred technology can't use it for any other purpose or transfer it to a third party without the permission of the auditor. If a research institute, etc., uses pre-approved technology for the production of a radioactive substance, without the consent of the auditor, for the production of a freshwater product, including a wastewater product, then the technology must be transferred to a technology-holding institution. Research institutions, if they want to make a patent or a trademark application for a new technology that they've developed using the technology that they've acquired before, they need to get the approval of the Minister of Defense Technology with the advice of the Department of Technology Resources. The contracts must include information about the prior technology utilization plans of the research institute, etc. After the contract, the research institute, etc., the head of the technology acquisition agency, on request, submits the status of the technology within one month of the date of request. If a research institute, for whatever reason, fails to use a technology that has been acquired in accordance with the Fourth Plan of Implementation, or fails to comply with any of the other terms and conditions of the contract, the contract may be terminated or terminated, in which case the contractor's fees are not refunded. The research institutions that have received the technology must submit the results of the misuse or return of the technology within one month after the termination of the contract to the head of the technology holding institution, unless they have the authority to continue to use the same technology within one month before the termination of the contract, and they bear the administrative and accountability obligations related to the use of the technology. When technology is transferred to a general vendor or institution, the technology must be removed or parts of the technology must be modified before it can be transferred to a general vendor or institution, and the technology must be managed and stored.

Businesses that need to write an interoperability plan are like each other. Weapons systems, Defense Intelligence Task Force: Requirements for synergy and unity Weapons and power transfer systems that exchange command and information. It's a power transfer system that's operated jointly by more than two military organizations.

The standard symmetry test system is the same as the next set of letters. A weapons system based on Korean-style mobile message format (KVMF). Weapons -- power transfer systems -- based on the Korean standard message format. Weapons based on Korea's Link-K. A weapons system that uses the combined tactical data link (Link-16, JREAP, Link-22, etc.) Among the systems that interact with the above-mentioned standards are the weapons, the power support systems, which are directed by the flag and the coalition. In some businesses, if you're going to apply a standardization test to a weapons system or a power supply system without changing a standardized terminal, you can circumvent the standardization test for that terminal.  Standard compatibility tests are conducted by Interactive Tenacity Centers, and commercial standards can be replaced by test results from outside certification agencies, except that standard compatibility tests for weapons systems that use the United States Military Operations Database (Link-16, JREAP, Link-22, etc.) can be conducted by Interactive Tenacity Centers or the U.S. Joint Testing Administration (JITC).  Standard Compatibility Tests and Interoperability Tests are conducted by Interoperability Centers in accordance with the annual plan, and the telecoms companies, the cyber companies, the geospatial information units, the 935th Air Force, are conducting their evaluations in the relevant fields, such as frequency, cyber capabilities, geospatial information, but the national government, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military and other relevant institutions need to take steps to ensure that the time frame for conducting the Interoperability Tests and Interoperability Tests is met.  The Department of Defense and the Joint Inspection Unit verify the evaluation results, classify them as follows, and report back to the enforcement agency within a month. Approval: if it meets all the interoperability requirements for power generation. Conditional approval: if there's no major flaw in the interoperability of power generation, but there's a need for improvement, or if the interoperability assessment results indicate that the cause of the milestones is a fault in the system. Non-approved: Unable to leverage interoperability for power generation. Section 7, Section 2, says, \"If there are no major deficiencies, but there is a need for improvement,\" the enforcement agency, \"If the cause of the benchmark milestone is a system error,\" the management department, \"Operating the system,\" reports to the national intelligence agency, the Joint Inspection Unit, that the system has been overhauled.

If you have a targeted weapon system, you prioritize testing between the real systems, but if the targeted system hasn't completed the development of the targeted behavior, or if the testing is limited, you replace the testing with a simulator or an emulator, and when you're ready to develop and evaluate the targeted system, you do an operational site-level interoperability assessment through the real system.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff decide on major operational capability, mobility and interoperability, and security measures, and the CSA decides on the technical and component performance, and in this case, in the areas of command control, communications and the Defense M&S system, the Department of Defense Intelligence Policy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and in the area of encryption, they have to consult with the Department of Defense Information Services in advance.  Operational readiness is the ability to meet the operational concepts of a unit power, the ability to meet the requirements for safety from operational failures and equipment failures, and the timing and procedures are identical to the next round. It provides us with operational flexibility for long-term decision-making. Operational readiness is determined at the time of the midterm review, which includes the midterm review, but in the case of exploration and development projects, it reflects the results. However, R&amp;D projects, where the Agency reflects the results of the detailed design review, and where it needs the opinion of the IAEA and other relevant bodies, submit the final operational readiness immediately after the detailed design review, and in this case, the team decides on the operational readiness within three months after the completion of the detailed design review, in accordance with the procedure set out in Chapter 28 of the Regulations. Rapid deployment determines maneuverability. In the case of functions, we can use dry-ability reviews to determine whether they're usable for long-term use, and then we can use the design results to determine whether they're usable for medium-term use, just like we can determine whether they're usable for function tonnage at the basic design stage. Joint ventures can be defined in terms of operating concepts, technological maturity, technological development trends and so on, and then they can be defined in terms of evolutionary operational capability, and then they can be defined in terms of ongoing research or development results.  They then take into account the different requirements, the operational capability that affects the operational concept, the performance of the components that affects the cost of the claim, and, if necessary, the requirements of the small-scale control system. The basic operating conditions that define the operational concept of a weapons system. The concept of single-power operations, the planning, and the things that directly affect operational execution. The payload capability of the payload carrier -- the equipment that's propelled by a different weapons system -- the main performance, the components of the weapons system that are determined by a set of units, the performance that can affect the performance of the main equipment. What's the key to security when you want to have a security function? Types of systems and interoperability. After consulting the relevant departments, such as the Department of Defense, the Joint Inspection Unit, the Relief and Works Agency, the Agency has to decide on the technical and partial performance after considering each of the following complaints, and then report the results to the Joint Inspection Unit and the Relief and Works Agency. In this case, the Relief and Works Agency has to participate in the Technical and Partial Performance Review Board that is chaired by the Agency, and the Agency reports the results to the Joint Inspection Unit. The concept of single-powered operations -- not changing the plan. It's the things that directly affect operational capability and operational efficiency. Environmental compatibility, ergonomic compatibility, scalability, standardization. Power generation. BITs, built-in tests, CBM+, Condition Based Maintenance Plus. In each of the following cases, the integration reflects operational capability, including technical and numerical performance, in the power supply. We've gone from organ care to mid-term care. The end of exploration and development. After completion of the concept of functioning inland drying. I wrote a new mid-term electricity plan. You write a quick power checklist. Within three months of completion of the detailed design review."

It provides us with operational flexibility for long-term decision-making. Operational readiness is determined at the time of the midterm review, which includes the midterm review, but in the case of exploration and development projects, it reflects the results. However, R&amp;D projects, where the Agency reflects the results of the detailed design review, and where it needs the opinion of the IAEA and other relevant bodies, submit the final operational readiness immediately after the detailed design review, and in this case, the team decides on the operational readiness within three months after the completion of the detailed design review, in accordance with the procedure set out in Chapter 28 of the Regulations. Rapid deployment determines maneuverability. In the case of functions, we can use dry-ability reviews to determine whether they're usable for long-term use, and then we can use the design results to determine whether they're usable for medium-term use, just like we can determine whether they're usable for function tonnage at the basic design stage."

In this case, the Joint Concept Team is appointed by the Joint Power Management Director.  The role of the think tank is the same as the next chapter. Identification of weapons systems for the realization of cooperative ideas. Necessity of an armed system, bias and definition of operations. Decision on the future operational environment, the level of defense technology, etc., and the required capabilities of the weapons system for the realization of operational utility, lightweight and power generation time etc. But if you need to, you can get a representative from the relevant institutions and departments to do a mid-term review of new drugs, including packaged drugs. Reliability Requirements, Reviewing Power Supply Factors A review of the need for high-tech application pilots In spite of Clause 1, if you're participating in a rapidly deferred decision-making process and you're doing precognition research under Clause 16, you can either simplify the formation and operation of a think tank, or you can combine the operation of a think tank with precognition research.  It's based on the principle that you run a think tank to write a power log for all new and renewable electrical units, but you can't run a think tank for performance and capacity.  They then form an integrated concept team, including the next generation of people. Department of Defense, Joint Venture, Temporary Agency, Temporary planning and testing.

If necessary, I'll go to the ministries of education, the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense University, civil research institutions, and I'll go to the defense policy and defense industry experts.

If you receive a request for a list of requirements that are not included in the list of requirements, the head of the Joint Power Planning Department decides whether to operate a united concept team, taking into account the compatibility, the comfort, the resource requirements.  The Joint Task Force on Emergency Requirements must operate an integrated concept team before the emergency decision is made, so that the critical review opinion of the Defense Department and the rapid capability review opinion of the IAEA -- the availability of power, the anticipated business-to-business issues -- are reflected in the power bill.  Joint ventures can be run by an integrated concept team, and they can commission researchers from national institutions, including trustees, and private sector institutions, if necessary, to look at export possibilities -- export conditions, development trends overseas.

Development Test & Evaluation: Testing to verify whether or not a prototype of a development device meets the requirements and development objectives. Operational Test & Evaluation: OT&E: testing the prototype of a development equipment to determine whether it's fit for use in a variety of operational environments, or similar conditions, and whether it's suitable for military use, and then, if it's deemed necessary for business characteristics and efficient budgeting, it can be performed by dividing it into the first test and the second test phases for the first generation decision. The evaluation of key technology R&amp;D projects is separated from each other, and the evaluation is done on the basis of R&amp;D plans. Development Testing: Testing whether the technology or equipment developed meets requirements, development goals, etc. Performance appraisal: if you have a weapons system that's going to use a developed technology or equipment, an appraisal to see if it's military-suitable for the weapons system you're going to use, and if you think it's necessary for business characteristics and for efficient budgeting, you can do it in a phase that's called an early appraisal phase and a phase that's called a post-appraisal phase. Testing the purchasing business can be done separately and complementarily, like each of the following. Real-world testing: It's a test for a weapons system or a prototype that's been developed, and then it's a national test, or an international test, to determine whether it's fit for purpose, whether it's suitable for military operations, whether it's suitable for military operations, whether it's suitable for power generation, and so on. But if you need to determine whether it's fit for purpose in Korea's operational environment, you add a national test along with an international test. Data-driven performance assessment: assessing whether the proposed performance is adequate or appropriate for the data provided by the company, including operational performance, supporting systems, and so on. This is done using performance data, performance checks and performance measurements (including the SBA Integrated Information System Registration), results of testing by the manufacturer, military use and sales practices in the country, and other data and information gathered. If you buy a test-driven weapons system under Article 36(1), you can replace the test scores under Article 4 with performance test results.  In the case of rapid deployment strategies, we need to include integration of development and operational assessments, and in the case of demonstration business, replacement assessments with performance assurances.

It conducts the test on the basis of a certified test plan.  The driving test should be conducted in real driving conditions, or similar environments, with extreme testing within the driving range, so that the performance can be measured in terms of the harshest and the coldest conditions, depending on the properties of the equipment.  Despite paragraph three, each of the following enterprises is replaced by an environmental assessment component of the development appraisal, except that if the performance of each of the enterprises needs to be evaluated against the odds or against the odds, then the appraisal can be conducted in accordance with the business-driven benchmarking strategy. It's a business driven by emergency decisions. Over 50 billion dollars worth of business. Voicemail systems, exercise systems, training systems, indoor ventilation systems. If you take the characteristics of the equipment and the operating environment into account, you can prove that it's technically feasible. The R&amp;D agencies provide all the data and technical support needed for the testing, and the PMI agencies provide monitoring to the EIA and the R&amp;D agencies to share and verify the data during the testing.  If you ask the regulatory authority to provide you with any corrections to any deficiencies that may have occurred during the course of the performance review, the R&amp;D agency will consult with the IAEA to provide you with corrections, and then, on the request of the IAEA, the technical assistance agency in Section 14 can provide you with a technically objective analysis of the IAEA's corrections, and then provide you with an action plan.  In the case of a simple discovery of a flaw that does not affect the performance of any of the test areas other than the private sphere of each company under Article 65(6) of the R&amp;D Guidelines, the R&amp;D Directorate has to submit the evidence to the testing authority that the flaw is not affecting the performance of any of the test areas.  If, in the course of a performance review, there is a private incident under Article 65(6) of the Regulation, and it is determined that the performance review is insufficiently complete during the performance review period, and there is a need to suspend the performance review, the review shall be suspended in consultation with the R&amp;D regulatory authority, and the review shall be forwarded to the Joint Inspection Unit and to the Agency for Radiation Protection.  If the operational testing is interrupted, the Agency will review the measures taken to address the shortcomings, the business impact, and so on, including the technical support provided by the Technical Assistance Agency, and will consult with the Joint Inspection Unit on whether to suspend or re-examine the operation, and will report the results to the Joint Inspection Unit, or the Joint Inspection Unit, or the Joint Inspection Unit and the Joint Inspection Unit, if necessary, depending on the importance of the matter.  They can temporarily suspend the shipment if they can be repaired during the lifetime of the test, they can resume the test if they don't have the supplies, they can report back to the IAEA when they resume the test, but if they can't make a decision about the disposal of the supplies, they can consult with the IAEA, and they can commission the inspection to the Technical Assistance Agency under Article 14.  In the case of a performance appraisal for a mining operation, we apply the following criteria. In addition, the National Institutes of Natural Resources and Rapid Response (NRAP) can provide technical personnel, equipment and supplies required for the conduct of the test, at the request of the IAEA. The supplier reports the results of the quality assurance of the development and testing and the quality assurance of the transportation before the launch of the testing to the relevant institutions, and the relevant institutions verify the results and evaluate them. The supplier will verify the performance and the results of the testing, and they will provide technical assistance to identify any problems that may arise during the testing.

The agency conducts the test on the basis of a test plan, a company's draft (which includes the additional data submitted by the company) and then a variety of other publicly available data. The data that the governments of the countries in which the product is being developed have written or accepted. The data that an international organization, or an international certification body, has produced or accepted. It's the data that's written and accepted by the international organizations that allow the participation. And the other thing is, the data that we've found is reliable. If you're a business that's contracted with a foreign government to buy a weapons system, you can use these contract lines and the quality assurance documents that are submitted by the government of that country to evaluate the test criteria.  If there's a shortcoming in the timeliness of the procurement review, the agency will notify the merger and the radiation regulator, and the merger and the merger will review the merger review team, or the review board of the proposed review, within the scope of fairness and equity and so on, and the merger and the merger will not be subject to review, and the merger and the merger will not be subject to review, and the merger and the merger and the merger will not be subject to review.  If a business that's undergoing a test is canceled, suspended or canceled, they have to report back to the merger, and the merger, in consultation with the merger, decides whether to continue the test and report back to the regulatory authority.  To ensure the transparency and reliability of our testing, we maintain and manage the data used in our test results.  If a small arms control agency conducts a data-driven test, it conducts a data-driven test for each of the two subparagraphs of Article 2, and submits the results to the Joint Inspection Unit, in which case the Joint Inspection Unit can use a specialized research institute under Article 10, Part 3, of the Act, and the Agency must submit the results of the development test conducted by the state or internationally recognized testing agency after the weapons system has been developed.  After completion of the test, the LRA then writes down the test results, including the next steps, and submits them to the pilots, who, if necessary, report them to the IAEA. Test scores. The test equipment, the quantity. Time and place for testing. Evaluation criteria, evaluation results -- including power generation support. The milestones and the supplements. Comprehensive insight. Other things. When conducting the purchase test, if an interoperability test is required, the interoperability test is conducted on the principle that the small arms and light weapons are performing, but in the case of each of the following categories, the Joint Resilience Technology Center can assess whether the test is feasible and support the test, and the detailed procedures are governed by the Joint Resilience Management Regulations. It's the equivalent of an interoperability test for fusion power. If a delay regulator asks for interoperability testing support for unit power, they'll be able to do it. They then reviewed whether each of the candidates met the criteria for the test assessment, and they conducted a trial according to Article 61(3). Testimonials from small arms and light weapons. The results of the evaluation of mobility and interoperability. If, in accordance with Article 61(4) of the Regulation, a supplementary measure is proposed from the crew that is deemed to be suitable for combat purposes, the Agency will report the results of the subsequent adjustment to the supplementary measure to the crew and to the deterrence mechanism.  In the case of a procurement business that is selected by a single vendor, we work with the regulatory agency and the radiation regulator to conduct a review of that business, taking into account the following considerations: whether there is a reopening or a suspension of the review, whether there is a reopening of the review business, whether the review results are conflict-of-war, and so on. The regulatory authority then, when it finds that the performance of the test cannot be maintained during the course of the test, and it decides that it is necessary to suspend the test on a personal basis, it suspends the test, and it reports this to the Joint Inspection Unit and the IAEA. If it finds that the equipment is too weak for combat purposes, it can review whether it's powered, whether it's usable or not, and then it can review whether it's worth re-testing, and then it can apply for re-testing through the Joint Appeals Board, or the Joint Appeals Board, or the Joint Appeals Board. The rescue agency then, in accordance with the instructions of the crew, prepares a plan of re-evaluation for the re-test, submits it to the crew, the crew reviewes it, then passes the checks and balances to the rescue agency and the rescue agency, but the crew can then consult with the relevant authority to prepare a plan of re-evaluation, taking into account the efficiency of the work. The Agency may not disclose the test results until the end of the price negotiations in order to maintain its bargaining power.  The Joint Inspection Unit works with the FEMA and the IAEA to promote simultaneous testing and negotiation of the weapons systems they buy.  If you repurchase a weapons system that's proven to be anti-personnel landmines, you can go back to the original test scores without any additional testing, but if you need a test score for some of the items, you can write a test score plan, and you can do a test score for some of the items, and you can go back to the original test scores for the other items.

Weapons systems development and test evaluation for technological development, which are carried out in cooperative military technology projects, apply Sections 59(2) to (3), 75(3), 76 and 77, respectively, and test evaluation for component nationalization is performed by the Agency for Radio-telecommunications and Transportation Administration, and the development and assembly test evaluation is performed only if the test evaluation criteria are met.  The test subjects for civil-military cooperation projects are chosen from among civil-military technology development projects and civil-military technology pre-production projects, and if there is a need for a weapons system to be applied, or if there is a need for military-military cooperation projects under the Civil-military Cooperation Projects Code, which the Ministry of Industrial Resources and Technology has proposed, the Ministry of Radiocommunications and Telecommunications, in consultation with the public, decides that the results of the research and development should be subject to military-military testing.  The Ministry of Defense can ask the Department of Defense for military testing, but in the case of Part 1, the Ministry of Defense asks the Ministry of Defense for component manufacturing testing.  The NSA has reviewed the need for military testing, and they commissioned the military to do military testing.  The cost of military testing is reflected in the R&D expenditure that is favourable to the R&D expenditure under the National Cooperation in Military Technology Projects Convention.  Military-related assessments of civil engineering cooperation projects are separated into development assessments and operational assessments at the testing and development stages, and operational assessments can be conducted only if there is a need for a weapons system to be applied, and the outcome of each evaluation is the same as the next one. Development Evaluation: Criteria for adequacy, or milestones for failure Driving test. In the evaluation of the performance of weapons systems development, we can determine whether it's a potentially combat-suitable or a potentially combat-needed assembly, whether it's a post-production transition, whether it's a post-production development, whether it's a potentially combat-needed assembly, and in this case, we have to conduct the evaluation of the performance to test the potential decision.  The departments and offices of the National Technical Cooperation Business Testing Authority are responsible for each of the following. Ministry of Defense. Come on. Radio. Small Arms and Light Weapons Testing Organization: Implementing the weapons system and core technology testing process Natural Resources, Resources, Natural Resources: Development Testing and Transportation Testing Support People's Co-operative Development Agency Development Evaluation Team. It's called the subjective research institute. The R&amp;amp;amp;D evaluation of public-private technology cooperation projects follows each of the following steps. The subjective research institution then writes the development review plan and submits it to the National Institute for the Development of Civilian Cooperation four months before the development review is launched. After registering the Development Evaluation Plan, the Department of Defense, in accordance with the instructions of the Joint Inspection Unit, shall establish a Development Evaluation Unit, including the subject research institution, the Joint Inspection Unit and, if necessary, the relevant Integrated Business Management Team, the Department of Defense, the Suppliers' Section, the Department of Defense, the relevant military, etc., and after reviewing the Development Evaluation Plan, the Development Evaluation Unit shall submit the Development Evaluation Plan to the Joint Inspection Unit's Joint Nuclear Power Operations Manual, and the Development Evaluation Unit shall submit it to the Joint Inspection Unit two months before the commencement of the Development Evaluation. Participants report the development testing evaluation plan to the National Academy of Sciences, the National Radiation Agency, and the Department of Small Arms and Light Weapons through a verification process under Chapter 60. The subjective research institution conducts the development review under the development review program. The subject research institution has to submit a development review report to the development review team, including any further relevant information. Test scores. The test equipment, the quantity. Time and place for testing. Testing items: criteria and evaluation results. Standard milestones and improvement plans. And the other thing is, the R&amp;amp;D review team recognizes that it's necessary. The R&amp;amp;amp;D review team will review the R&amp;amp;amp;D results report submitted by the subject research institution and submit it to the National Committee for Cooperative Development within one month from the completion of the R&amp;amp;D review to make a decision on the R&amp;amp;D review.  After reviewing the results of the development review that they submitted, they proceed to take a decision in accordance with Article 61(3), and they report the results to the National Institutes of Health, the National Radiation Agency and the Small Arms and Light Weapons Administration.  The NSA is able to deploy in the wild and ask for a roll-out test if it has a proven military capability, if it has a proven need for a roll-out system.

Joint forces, the Air Force and the IAEA need to take the following into account when acquiring power supply support elements to develop and ensure. The cost-effective economic operation of the entire lifetime of the weapons system. Maintain standardization and compatibility of claims and support equipment. We've developed a system that allows us to use existing support systems to minimize operating costs. Ensuring predictability and sustainability of electricity supply. When it comes to the mobility of the power-generation support components of weapons systems that are in the process of being generated and powered, it's up to the IAEA to review the necessity and appropriateness of national defense and coalition efforts, and then it's up to the IAEA to incorporate them into the weapons systems business, or to ensure that they're developed in the context of a separate business.  One of the elements of the electrification is the fight-force element, and we're going to work with each of the following companies to develop and secure it, and the budget for the fight-force element that the combined forces and the small battalions have to get is going to be funded by the U.S. Air Force. Joint Forces: military doctrine, uniformity, training, frequency. EOD: Hardware, software needed for interoperability of facilities, weapons systems In order to acquire the frequency of a warfare booster, the small arms control unit has to submit a public frequency usage plan to the unit, request permission to use it, and the unit has to consult with the Department of Defense, the Department of Information Technology Policy, to review the Department's public frequency allocation plan and obtain permission to use the Department of Defense's frequency. In this case, the U.S. Agency for Radio-telecommunications Services (AES) has to provide the military and the unit with the frequency data, and to provide the necessary information for the acquisition of the frequency.  In spite of paragraph 5, if the reflection in the public frequency allocation plan is limited to core technology and future-oriented technology R&amp;D, emergency power acquisition, etc., then, in accordance with each of the following categories, the entity acquires the frequency in collaboration with the Department of Defense (Department of Intelligence and Information Technology Policy) and the Joint Inspection Unit (Department of Radiocommunications), and the details of paragraphs 5 and 6 are governed by Sections 3 and 6 of the Joint Inspection Unit's Radio Management Rules. Core Technology and Future Technologies R&D: Business Research Institutions Demonstration work: the E.U., the military, the Navy. Emergency shelter power acquisition: squadron. The integrated system support component of the electrification component is under the auspices of the U.S. Agency for Radio-television and Telecommunications, and it enables development and maintenance solutions that reflect the opinions of the participants and the troop contributors.  If they want to establish, they get the relevant data from the reservoirs -- data that can judge the reservoirs and the timing, etc. -- and they write a policy and a plan, and then they report it to the reservoirs. If they want to establish a policy and a plan, they consult with the reservoirs. If they want to establish a policy and a plan, they consult with the reservoirs. If they want to establish a policy and a plan, they consult with the reservoirs. If there's an additional requirement for the development of the reservoirs, they consult with the reservoirs, and they review the cost, performance, schedule, and so on.  One of the plans that the E.U. writes under section eight is to build a life-cycle management plan that includes the integrated system support component of the Life-cycle Management Task Force.  The Air Ministry or the Air Force should commission the Air Force to review the pre-assessment capability and standard equipment requirements for the post-acquisition of precision measuring equipment through the introduction of weapons systems and equipment and the pursuit of R&amp;D projects, and the Air Force should report the results of the review to the Air Ministry or the Air Force. The Air Ministry or the Air Force should submit the pre-assessment capability for precision measuring equipment to the Air Force in the life-cycle management plan for new business, reflecting the standard equipment, the technical manuals, the manuals, the equipment requirements, and so on.  The troop can claim the cost of having a weapons system sensor mounted at the time of deployment, or of having an automated data collection system that uses sensor data, CBM+, and the CSA can confirm the cost of CBM+ through consultation with the troop in advance and exploration and development phases, and reflect it in the system development phases.

When preparing a business plan, a business director's office can decide how to conduct an appropriate test, such as replacing a three-stage assessment, a one-stage assessment, or an environmental test between development and testing, taking into account the characteristics of a major product, or changes in the operating environment, etc., when preparing a test pilot plan.  Testing is done by a small agency, and when it's a product that has no significant impact on the performance, reliability or durability of the finished product, it can only be tested for development, or it can only be tested for operation, according to a decision of a business directory, and then simple systems and seasonal items according to each of the following categories can simplify the test for operation. Simple systems: the lowest-level system that can perform a single function, that cannot be functionally separated, that has nothing to do with weapons systems, that doesn't cause any loss of life in the event of malfunction or failure. Seasonal traits: seasonal traits that are only temporarily available in certain seasons, such as the Eastern Hemisphere. The R&amp;D agency has to write an integrated test plan for each of the development and operational testing items that are selected to be integrated into the test baseline plan, and if necessary, they can be included in the development test plan without writing an integrated test plan.  In the case of R&amp;D, under the auspices of the Defense Department -- the Department of Defense, the Department of Military Affairs, the Department of Advanced Power Management -- or a small arms control agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration conducts risk assessments and technical assistance for development, and the small arms control agency conducts test-driven testing.  It reviews the development review plans written by the developers for development review and technical assistance, reports them to the Department of Defense and the requesting authority, and if necessary, the requesting authority can participate in or attend the development review of the project.  When a developer asks a business management organization to conduct an evaluation of a development product, they have to include a self-assessment document, a supplier's opinion document, a company's performance document, an arms embargo document, etc., and in the case of an evaluation of a development product, the evaluation organization concludes a contract with the developer to conduct the evaluation, and in this case, the cost of the evaluation is borne by the developer.  When business management organizations can't conduct development or operational evaluations, they can commission public institutions to do them.  Evaluation of the state-of-the-art products that have been manufactured using technology from abroad can be replaced by business management organizations in collaboration with small and medium-sized enterprises, with relevant data such as the development status of the manufacturer, the test results, the specifications and the sales records, and evaluation of the assembled products can be replaced by performance testing.  Business management organizations can use national and foreign public testing facilities to test and evaluate the results of national and foreign public testing institutions, in cases where testing is difficult.  If the test results suggest that a military solution is needed, it's up to the discretionary authority, and the results are reported to the business management authority.  The institution that conducts the development and operational review reports the results to the business management organization, and the business management organization reports the results to the business directory.

The classification of the exhibition airlift business is based on the results of the classification of the airlift business, which is already routinely classified and managed for the purpose of preparing for the exhibition, and then it is reclassified, taking into account each of the following factors. Business necessity: looking at war patterns and perspectives Power potential. I don't know if it's a contract. A flat-rate bias in the exhibition budget includes the results of the classification of the radiation improvement work for the exhibition, the power consumption that has been confirmed for the exhibition, and the deficiency in the exhibition control equipment. The exhibition adjusts the bias in the exhibition budget according to the results of the re-distribution of the radiation improvement work and the power consumption decisions.  The average power consumption of an exhibition-related force is determined by the failure of the Joint Strategic Planning Headquarters as the main force requiring a troop-contributing force during a wartime period, including the deficiency of an exhibition component due to delay or discontinuity, and by the failure of the Joint Commander-in-Chief after the decision of the Joint Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Task Force, the Joint Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Task Force, the Joint Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Task Force, the Joint Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Task Force, the Joint Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Task Force, the Joint Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Task Force, the Joint Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Task Force, the Joint Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Task Force, or, if necessary, the Joint Exhibition Task Force.  Each unit determines the equipment to be acquired due to a condition or a single species in the absence of exhibition control equipment, and submits the exhibition equipment, including normal catchable equipment, to the Agency, and then the Agency conducts a final review of the productivity, availability and expected cost-effectiveness of each exhibition company.  The Air Force, the Navy, the Department of Defense, in consultation with the relevant agencies, will review the allocation of aircraft to improve air quality, and then the Department of Defense will recast the budget and report back to the Department of Defense.  The Ministry of Defence, through the Standing Committee for the Prevention of Exposure, reports the results of the business redistribution and budget restructuring to the army, the navy and the relevant agencies.  The Agency reports to the Department of Defense, the Department of Planning, the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense.  The Department of Defense oversees the planning department so that the coordinated exhibition budget can be reflected in the Secretary of State's emergency budget for consideration.  The exhibition support system business is where each military and naval force that is empowered by the Defense Department to prepare for an exhibition transition is normally classified and then reclassified on the basis of the results of the business classification that is under management, and then it's reported to the Defense Department -- the Military Administration, the Advanced Power Management Administration -- and then the development business is reviewed first for procurement, and then the development business is streamlined, and then it's reclassified into the early warning business, the normal operations business, the operational operations business.  The exhibition power subsidy budget, which is comparatively biased, includes the results of the classification of the exhibition power subsidy business, and the power and spare equipment shortfall that has been confirmed for the exhibition, and the relevant contents are included in the cost plan. In the exhibition, we adjust the scope of the bias according to the results of the reclassification of the radiation extension business and the decision on the exhibition power shortfall.  The cost of the parallel power supply system for the pre-exposure force is determined by the decommissioning of the commander of the army, the decommissioning of the commander of the Eastern Command, or, if necessary, the decommissioning of the commander of the Defense Forces, as the primary force required for the decommissioning of the force in the early stages of war, including the decommissioning of the components due to disability or disability.

Part-time management focuses on pre-planning, anticipating the problem of a part-time problem, devising alternatives -- general procurement, redesign/engineering, development of equivalents, procurement of alternative suppliers -- and establishing and implementing procedures to maximize the impact of military support on the acquisition and operation of the weapons system. A stockpile management plan should be written to reflect the stockpile situation and responses to the stockpile of a given weapons system, and the relevant institutions should follow through on the stockpile management plan and maintain the stockpile on a sustainable basis. We need to do a lot of military stockpile standardization -- standardization, listing, image control -- while developing weapons systems for spare parts management so that we don't have a negative impact on spare parts movement rates. The Department of Defense has to designate and operate a dedicated research institute to systematically and efficiently manage a variety of components, and the IAEA, the military, the Navy, the National Museum, has to maintain a components department or a staff. The EIA then has to get the R&amp;D agency and contractor to submit a scrapping plan, and then they have to put the scrapping information into the scrapping information system, and then after the scrapping plan has been agreed upon by the scrapping team, they have to be transferred to each military and naval force. Each army and each Marine has to demand a stockpile management solution at an early stage. Suppliers have to carry out research, analysis, research and technical support on the stockpile at the level of overall stockpile life cycle management, and they have to provide training on stockpile management to the industry and to the suppliers, and they have to review the suitability of the stockpile management plans that the suppliers have written. In the case of R&amp;D, the Agency has to get R&amp;D regulators to evaluate the risk profiles of components of weapons systems from the design stage, and to include the risk profiles of components in the R&amp;D plan, including the pre-selected components and the management responses, and so on, in accordance with Schedule VI.  Suppliers can build and deploy a components management information system to effectively manage their components, and they can share their information with government agencies and disarmament actors.  The components management team can be composed of the military, the navy, the radiation ministry, the state government, the suppliers, the developers and the manufacturers.  The E.U., when it acquires a weapons system, the military and the Navy, if they require a certificate to acquire the classified components of the main equipment and components, they can review the eligibility and reflect them in the E.U.

In order to solve the problem of operating-grade component types, we identify the need for improved components through a screening study of the Creative Commons, and we replace them with improved components that match the current technology levels of the Creative Commons, and to do this, the suppliers analyze and research the unique information on the Creative Commons target equipment.

Composition and role of the components management team The criteria for selecting pre-trained and pre-available goods and the categories of goods that can be identified. Identify component types, develop responses, verify, debug. We need to reflect that in our inventory planning and other parts management. In order to minimize the impacts of the proliferation of components between R&amp;D projects, the Agency and the relevant agencies work together to develop components management plans for each of the next generations, taking into account the overall lifespan of the project from the beginning. The Agency manages the acquisition of the weapons system, and it works with the major contractors and participating suppliers of the weapons system to manage the acquisition. The EIA should be able to streamline and supplement the component type management plan as the R&amp;D work progresses, so that it can be managed from generation and operational stages. It's going to get the R&amp;D department to come up with a plan for the development of components for that weapons system.

The EIA and the relevant agencies follow each of the following steps in R&amp;D to assess and pre-screen the risks associated with components. R&amp;D institutions evaluate the risk of a novelty by taking into account its impact, its mortality, its likelihood of occurrence, its feasibility of resolution, etc., and for a novelty that is high-risk, they have to develop a response plan from the design stage, write a novelty management plan, and a professional R&amp;D institution has to review the appropriateness of this. The parts management plans that are reviewed under number one are validated by the parts management team review, and the parts management team can then operate through the system support management meetings. The pre-treatment items are written in the seventh column of the registry, and they're managed in the appendix to the registry, but the items that are restricted from being entered in the current registry information system, such as the name of the original creator, the information source, the information point, etc., are entered in the registry information system as an add-on file, like the registry information system. The Agency can request technical assistance from suppliers for the identification, analysis, formulation and implementation of alternatives for all of its management activities, and it can consult with suppliers if necessary to further commercialize it.  The radiation agency will consult with the suppliers about the types of components that have occurred, or are expected to occur, and consider incorporating them into the nationalization plan in order to respond in advance to the type of components.  R&amp;D institutions need to design and develop individual modular systems that take into account performance, cost, timeliness, etc., to be able to respond flexibly to the next generation of components.  R&amp;D institutions need to design components to minimize the use of proprietary components, to make components more common, to standardize components, to apply commercial components.  The radiation agency then reviews and supplements the review of the screening team's opinion on the proposed inventory management plan, and then it also reviews and supplements the opinion of each military department's inventory management department.

The Director of National Defence, or the Director of Supplies, has to support the yearly cooperation between the weapons system and the R&amp;D project, if requested by the Director of Integrated Business Management.  The head of the integrated business management team, if the test and development task is determined to be a temporary one after the first test and evaluation, then the way to acquire it can be transferred to the purchasing business, and the National Institute of Technology and Materials (NITI) has to provide technical assistance and alternatives to the problems of the post-test and evaluation.  The core technology R&amp;D business needs to be driven by the planning, planning, business management, etc. of the weapons system, and the results of the testing and evaluation will be applied to the weapons system after it has been determined and standardized as \"suitable for military use,\" but if it's necessary to meet the requirements of the powering time, etc., if the business headquarters approval has been obtained, if the development has been completed abroad, or if it's a developing product that's in use, then it can be applied to the weapons system for testing.  The Director of the National Museum and the Director of Goods can provide prototypes to small battalions in each of the following cases, but if the production cost of a prototype exceeds one million dollars, it has to be approved by the relevant Executive Committee. The small battalion was asked to use a prototype that had been developed as a core technology development. If the state decides that it needs to provide a prototype to a small battalion, it needs to verify its performance, its training, its ability to deliver improvements, and so on. Section 5 states that if you provide a prototype to a convoy, you can include it in the R&amp;amp;D plan, including the required quantities and capabilities as identified by the convoy and by the crew.  In accordance with Section 5 of the Regulations, the Director of the National Laboratory and the Director of Supplies must provide the samples to the small battalion together with the safety and reliability data of the samples.  If an R&amp;D agency or a R&amp;D participation agency intends to co-own the intellectual property rights of the development achievements in accordance with Section 1(2) of Articles 10 and 13 of the Act, the Director of Goods (Director of National Expenditures) must perform the tasks requested by the Director of the Ministry of Defense to review the qualifications of the co-owner, etc., for the signing of the contracts under the \"Guidelines for the Management of Intellectual Property Rights.\"  The R&amp;D agency and the R&amp;D participating agency must submit the feasibility of the R&amp;D results to the Director of National Parks and the Director of Goods for a period of five years from the year in which the results of the evaluation are notified, if the results of the evaluation are assessed as \"competitive\" or \"successful.\"  The Director of National Defence and the Director of Supplies are required to compile and analyze annually the feasibility studies of developments submitted in accordance with Section 1 of the Regulations, and submit them to the Department of Defense Technology Protection and the Advanced Technology Task Force.  The details of the feasibility management of the results of the development are governed by separate regulations issued by the National Laboratory Administration and the Director of Supplies.  If the head of the integrated business management team requests a company (hereinafter referred to as \"the participating company\") that wishes to participate in the development of a weapons system under the authority of the organization, the head of the integrated business management team must support the participating company with the necessary tasks, such as providing details of the results of the development, pre-technology counseling and education, in order to apply the technology developed by the organization to the participating company.
